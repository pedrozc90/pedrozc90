# Pedro Z. Campos - aka Luaerror

Hey, I’m Pedro.  
I started programming back in 2013–2014 because of World of Warcraft addons — shoutout to [TukUI](https://www.tukui.org/welcome.php).  
Lua was my first real language and it’s still one of my favorites.

## 💻 Work

+   **2019 - present**: I’ve been working full-time as a full stack developer at a company building web applications for RFID tag printing and management. The stack includes mostly `Java 8` + `Play Framework`, `PostgreSQL`, `RabbitMQ`, and `Angular` (it was `AngularJS` before — yes, I survived that too). Not the most exciting project, but I still enjoy the coding part.

## 🔧 Tinkering

I try to learn whatever tools are needed for work — like Micronaut, Quarkus, Docker, RabbitMQ, and more...  
Sometimes I mess with side projects: local web apps for Raspberry Pi, small scrapers, or Elixir + Phoenix experiments...  
I’ve tried a bunch of frameworks, liked a few... but I hated all. 😅  
but nothing that really stuck — yet.

## ⚙️ What I Like

- **Lua** — the gateway drug
- **Elixir** — great syntax and mindset
- **PostgreSQL** — solid and reliable
- **TypeScript / Node.js** — when the stars align
- **wow-lua** — [@wow-lua](https://github.com/wow-lua/repositories), where I keep all my WoW addon stuff

Frontend? I’ll do it... but only if I have to.

Thanks for stopping by.

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk code, WoW, or random side projects. 👾
